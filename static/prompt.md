I have a file named chats-without-media.txt file where, which is an export of my whatsapp chat with myself. It's something I use to save necessary links for myself. Can you please extract out all the necessary links from here, which are learning related, skip the personal messages. Give the output in some structured format (maybe markdown). You can understand that some messages might be quoted if they have nearby timestamp. Figure that out too. The reason this happens is because I have this habit of writing/pasting some link, and then quoting it in message and attaching some description to it. So yes please help me with this, I want to get links that I would use for my learning, which would be mostly things related to computer science. The output should be in markdown syntax and save it to a file named 'MiscellaneousSavedLinks.md'
