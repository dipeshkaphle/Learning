Recently I moved to Harmonic which is also a HN client. It uses a slighly differnt format for exporting bookmarks. The format I'm understading is `<hn-post-id>q<some-number-which-i-couldn't-figure-out>-<last-pattern repeated>`. Use this information and write a python script that converts this to Materialistic style bookmarks. You'd need to fetch the HN article, extract it's link and figure it out basically after that. Please do this and write a file.
